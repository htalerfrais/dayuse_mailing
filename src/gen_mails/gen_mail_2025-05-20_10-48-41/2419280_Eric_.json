I'm writing to recommend two 5-star hotels in Paris based on your previous booking preferences.\n\nThe first hotel I recommend is the Pullman Paris La D\u00e9fense. Located in the heart of the business district, this hotel offers a luxurious stay with modern amenities. The suite room with one king bed and two single beds is available from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm and is priced at 5 stars.\n\nThe second hotel I recommend is the Park Manor Hotel. This hotel is located in a quiet area of Paris and offers a deluxe room with one king bed. The room is available from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm and is also priced at 5 stars.\n\nBoth hotels offer excellent service and amenities, and I believe they would be a great fit for your next trip to Paris.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to book a room at either of these hotels.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n\nAssistant AI"
